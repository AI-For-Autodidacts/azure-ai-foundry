# AI Apps & Agents Factory

!!! info "If I had to summarize the Azure AI Foundry story at Microsoft Build, it would be **unified developer experience for building AI apps and agents anchored by observability and trust**. Let's explore that in this collection."

## 1. The Agent Factory: Stack

The Azure AI Foundry story begins with this refreshed stack that highlights a **unified AI-native development experience** using _Visual Studio Code_, _GitHub_ and _Azure_ to create solutions that effectively span code, collaboration, and cloud.

1. **Foundry Models** - provide the best model choice to jumpstart your dev journey.
1. **Foundry Agents** - enable complex workflows with integrated tools & governance.
1. **Foundry Services** - provide turnkey solutions for search, ML, content safety & more.
1. **Foundry Observability** - provides the end-to-end tools & insights needed for trusted AI.

The _developer tools_ ecosystem (VS Code, GitHub, Copilot Studio and Foundry SDK) focus on streamlining the AI developer experience from idea to production. The _deployment targets_ (Azure, Azure Arc, Foundry Local) provide flexibility in runtime - scaling from the cloud to edge devices.

## 3. The Agent Factory: Mindmap
The canonical blog post for Azure AI Foundry at Microsoft Build 2025 [can be found here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ai-foundry-your-ai-app-and-agent-factory/). As a visual learner, I find it useful to "mind-map" the space to get a better idea of what to explore in a more organized way. **Here is my initial version** highlighting 10 things to explore. I'll dive into each in the next few posts, with relevant links for self-guided exploration.
