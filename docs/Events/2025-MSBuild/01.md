## 1.1 Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini


1. Starting today, xAI’s flagship Grok 3 models are available for a **free preview in Azure Foundry for the next 2 weeks**. Grok models are also available to try on GitHub models.
1. According to xAI, Grok 3, the flagship model, **blends unparalleled reasoning with vast pretraining knowledge**, honed on xAI’s Colossus supercluster with 10x the compute power of prior leading models. 
1. **Grok 3 models** excel in reasoning, mathematics, coding, world knowledge, and instruction-following, setting a new standard for enterprise AI. 
1. **Grok 3 Mini**, a lightweight yet powerful thinking model, is optimized for logic-based tasks, delivering efficiency without compromise

## 1.2 GPT-Image-1 and SORA

**[GPT-Image-1](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/gpt-image-1/version/2025-04-15/registry/azure-openai)**: Gpt-image-1 includes significant improvements on image generation: it has generate high-quality images in challenging scenarios and solving challenging prompts. Currently the model has great zero-shot capabilities in image in-painting, photorealistic photos, and wireframe designs.

**[SORA](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/sora/version/2025-05-02/registry/azure-openai)**: Sora generates videos from text prompts that are provided by the user (with image to video coming soon). It generates videos up to 20s in duration and 1080p resolution. Sora focuses on generating commercially safe content, ideal for customers in advertising, media, and entertainment. It can also be used to create onboarding videos for various enterprises. It is accessible via the Azure OpenAI Service.

## 1.4 Enterprise-Grade Fine Tuning

!!! quote "Reinforcement Fine-Tuning introduces a new level of control for aligning model behavior with complex business logic. By rewarding accurate reasoning and penalizing undesirable outputs, RFT improves model decision-making in dynamic or high-stakes environments."

1. Use Reinforcement Fine-tuning with o4-mini to build reasoning engines that learn from experience and evolve over time. **Use Cases:** Complex decision-making, adaptive workflows, dynamic response generation, and context-sensitive interactions. Available in East US2 and Sweden Central. _Now in public preview_.
1. **Global Training: Expanding Access** - We’re making fine-tuning even more accessible by launching Global Training in public preview. You can now fine-tune Azure OpenAI models from any of the 24 Azure OpenAI regions with reduced per-token training rates, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for model customization.
1. **Developer Tier: Afforable Evaluations** - the most cost-effective way for developers and data scientists to evaluate their fine-tuned OpenAI models. Simultaneously evaluate multiple models to choose the best candidate for production.
